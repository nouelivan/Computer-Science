# Computer-Science

Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

* I'm a former (about a year of experience) automation engineer teaching myself the ins and outs of coding.
* Currently I'm working on mastering my computer science (Data Structures & Algorithms, Databases, Computer Architecture, and Discreete Math) related knowledge.
* Loving the process!
